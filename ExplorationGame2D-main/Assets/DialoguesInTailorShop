This is definitely not your head. Your appearance should've been well-maintained.
This, is ugly.
It twitches and twists and has every organ fighting each other.
But this is your head. This is your head now, and this has been your head since at least 50 years ago.
You know you are stuck here, with this pathetic tailor. 
The business barely hangs on. 
And our tailor, "A", is about to shut his store down.
But first, he needs to find his last 3 orders and deliver them to his last customers.

And besides, the pain of sickness is almost killing him for the second time.

Why, my friend. We are all dead. A common sense, you know?
->IntroChoices



===WhatOrders===
Guess what? You are a tailor. And what else? You make customized clothes for our dead citizens. Your last orders are in the box. Your customers will only pay you once the clothes are delivered.

"People hardly need to buy new ones after purchasing my crafts, for they are far too durable and good. And the population decreases nonstop. Frankly, I've only received three orders this year."

===WhoAmI===
You don't know. The only thing you know is that you can talk to the tailor, and you are stuck with this poor patient.

The clothes stiches look unfinished. The decayed texture indicates that the work was quitted a long time ago.

"Maybe 90, 100 years ago, yes. Back then, every dead pursued fashion and tailored clothes. 
"But as people lived longer and longer, they no longer found joy in the craftsmanship of an old tailor like me."
