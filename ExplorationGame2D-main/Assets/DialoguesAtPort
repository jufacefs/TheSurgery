===Alma===
The tailor encounters a young person with three boobs on their face.
*["Are you new here? I have never seen your face before."]->AlmaStartTalkingKnot

===AlmaStartTalkingKnot===
The person says:"Ah, sir, or ma'am, or whatever. It's hard to tell what you are. I'm Alma, died yesterday. "
~AlmaStartTalking()
"Fresh and lively.The Union just dumped me here."
"You know what? I was wondering why no one was here to welcome me, and then you showed up."
*["...Welcome. But I'm actually leaving."]->AlmaSecondRound
*["Unfortunately, I'm not here to welcome you.I'm going to where you came from."]->AlmaSecondRound
*["Good to be dead."]->AlmaSecondRound


===AlmaSecondRound===
Alma seems to be in his own world and doesn't reply to the tailor's greetings,"Those cloaked folks rough as hell, hauling me down here all tied up."
*["I recall they were quite polite when moving me down here."]->DieReason
*["How did you die?"]->DieReason

===DieReason===
Alma says:" Well, I was in debt. I got run over by a lender's car. Maybe that's why the Union didn't care much about my body."
*["That's rough."]->WasIdiot
*["Sounds like late capitalist society."]->WasIdiot




===WasIdiot===
Alma continues the rant:"I'm an idiot. A loser. An underdog. I couldn't remember anything, not any useful knowlegdge. But not anymore."
"They said, when carrying my body, that after death, one has infinite life and memory in the underground city. Isn't that great? "
"If I had known, I would have died earlier! I was going to die anyway when I was alive. But dead as I am now, I'm alive forever! And smart!"
*["Having endless memory isn't necessarily a good thing."]->FoolLikeMe
*["I doubt that."]->FoolLikeMe
*["eternal existence here is pure torment. There's a reason why the deads are called the deads."]->FoolLikeMe

===FoolLikeMe===
Alma seems a little angry:"But of course it is a good thing! With infinite life and memory, I'll eventually know everything by endless training and making mistakes."
*["Sounds like machine learning."]->AlmaImagine
*["Yes, you can do that. All deads are like databases. Even CE the Alzheimer-ed star."]->AlmaImagine


===AlmaImagine===
Alma is in a zest:"Then, I could be a poet, a drummer, a silversmith, a botanist, an opera singer, and...and a professor, no, a SAGE!"
"Sir, this is a revolutionary liberation of the brain! I suggest everyone die, RIGHT NOW!"
*["Many of my old friends did pursue dramatically different careers in their prolonged death..."]->WhatDoYouDo

===WhatDoYouDo===
Alma interrupts the tailor:"So, what do you do? How long have you been dead?"
*["Just a humble tailor. Been dead for 250 years."]->YouIdiot

===YouIdiot===
Alma says:"Oh, I see. So you are the IDIOT. 200 years was only enough for you to do just that."
"No wonder you want to leave this place. It seems the infinite life and memory haven't elevated you. What a waste."
*["Maybe. Who knows."]->ForReal
*[" But I like making clothes for others."]->ForReal


===ForReal===
Alma exclaims in shock:"Wait, for real? No legends and tales, uncle? Swords and magic, love and hatred, redemption and sin? And...."
*["No."]->Imsuffering
*["Maybe."]->Imsuffering
*["Maybe you are not an idiot. You are just an asshole socially."]->Imsuffering


===Imsuffering===
I'm just suffering like every other dead.

~PlayEffect()
(This young son of a bitch. He's giving the old tailor both mental and physical damage.)
But Alma doesn't plan to get it over with,"I had heard the city of the dead was grand and orderly because of the endless knowledge. Yes, Yes! I recall that the Union used to send people down here to learn every year!" 
->AfterImSuffering

===AfterImSuffering
Alma becomes somewhat frantic: "Had I known death was so good, I would have killed myself earlier."
~StopEffect()
"I'm gonna be the smartest!"
(Maybe he is just an idiot. Thinking of this, A relaxes a little.)
*["You must have mistaken something, kid."]->AlmaAskForget
*["It was, 50 years ago. People weren't so ill back then."]->AlmaAskForget
*["Right, smartass."]->AlmaAskForget

===AlmaAskForget===
The tailor goes on,"People here flee or die. Now, I'm leaving too, to forget."
Alma:"Forget? What a waste. What a waste!"
" Do you have any idea on my life? I was laughed at because I can't remember anything. But now, I'm different! I can feel it, I remember every word you say clearly!"
"If I live another fifty years, wouldn't I become an elite grandee? Just like a vampire!"
A is getting tired of Alma and turns to leave.
"Wait, are you leaving? For real?"
*["Yes."]->WhereAreYouGoing
*["There's nothing left here for me."]->WhereAreYouGoing
*["I can't stand it anymore. Memories."]->WhereAreYouGoing
*["I want to be an idiot, like you."]->WhereAreYouGoing


===WhereAreYouGoing===
"To the upper city. Have you not been listening to me at all?"
Alma says:"Though you only have knowledge of making clothes...But that's still some wisdom. Are you going to abandon your centuries of knowledge to become a forgetful fool again? "
*["Yes."]->HappyPerson
*["Yes."]->HappyPerson
*["Yes."]->HappyPerson


===HappyPerson===
"A forgetful human is a living human,  not necessarily a fool. Being a fool is your own problem."
Alma says:" You don't wanna continue challenging the peaks of knowledge with your limitless energy, professor? Besides, the upper city has been protesting against the Union lately.It's all a mess. The Union is severely understaffed, and the city is full of idiots everywhere. "
~AlmaEndTalking()
"But we've learn that here is the heart of civilization from textbooks since kindergarten..."
*["Great! Glad that you are not one of the idiots this time!"]->END
*["Great.Since no one's guarding, I'll make a run for it."]->END
*["Well, good luck becoming a professor. Gotta run."]->END
*["Suit yourself here, but I'm the idiot going up."]->END



===Lighthouse===
The lighthouse is shut down because the Lighthouse keeper got arrested.
There is an unknown corpse under the lighthouse.
The tailor murmurs:"I remember WS and WE jumped from this tower. Is this place a popular spot for suicides, or has the undertakers long stopped operating?"
~LoseScore(1)
(Emotional damage)
(Well,well. There's just no way you can avoid A's friends' suicide spots. They are everywhere.)
"You know what? I shall be with them. There's no meaning." A sounds serious.
*[Don't kill yourself. It's ridiculous to die twice]->DontSuicide
*[Run to the uppercity and everything will be fine.]->DontSuicide
*[At least I'm sure you will have a gigantic Holloween party if you do that.]->DontSuicide
+ [Back] -> END




===DontSuicide===
"Okay,okay!"
"I... I'm getting the hell out of here!"
The tailor looks overly excited
->END

===Seagull===
(Chirps) Sailor! Sailor! Sail towards the raging sea!
->END
