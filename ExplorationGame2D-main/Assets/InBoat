Those good old days. Her head was smooth like an egg by then."

~activate("BlackScreen")
You can't believe you and this old tailor sailed for 5 whole days.
A needs no food because he's dead, but it is boring as hell.
You wrote some brief notes in A's mind:
"Day 1: Our pockets light but spirits high, We're ready to outwit the Union or at least die humorously trying.
Day 2: Amidst the vast wet nothingness, we were briefly joined by dolphin skeletons. I guess the janitors are all gone. Oh, no, maybe the janitors are among them? Oh, hell no.
Day 3: Yes, a storm. Seagulls keep crashing on our front windows. RF should've seriously taught me how to speak bird language.
Day 4: Post-storm, the sea pretended nothing happened, all calm and shiny, while we navigated by stars that didn't care if we died again. Ah, tailor, good old fella. I think we are almost there.
Day 5: We found the tunnel's mouth. Looks like the Union also gone bankrupt. 
It still retains some of its once majestic structure, but the stacks of debris prove that it has fallen into disrepair over the years.
At least there's no Union bastards hanging around."
