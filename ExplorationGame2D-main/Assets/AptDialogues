CE:"Have you not throught about it? All of us share the same symptoms, how can you ask such an ignorant question? 
    You enjoy being tortured by memories? Or do you plan to run away?"

CE says:"Don't know, my condition seems to progress slower...They hailed me as an idol  because of my smooth cheeks.I was an idol. A star. A healthy dead. A carefree butterfly.
I'm trying to resume those good old days."
"Maybe one day I'll have to leave too."
"Dead and gone and shattered. It's about to become a ghost town."
*[Let's run away. To the upper city, where people live and forget.]->SomeOtherDay
* [What is the point of staying here anyways?]->SomeOtherDay

===SomeOtherDay===
CE says:"Don't know.Some other day, tailor. Some other day. The spikes hurt me from time to time, but they also kept me alert and conscious."
"You know, I don't want to be an idiot that remembers nothing. So pain it be. But leave this sad place as you wish and don't worry about me."
*["Or maybe you can have a surgery to remove these tumors."]
CE says:"Oh cut the jokes. There's no doctor left in this town.Some other day, tailor, some other day."
"Maybe forgetting is the only surgery to take."

CE:"Awh stop it, sweet heart. Stop the flatter. I wouldn't say that I was fortunate to have Alzheimer before my first death.But it is true that I didn't endure the burden of prolonged memory now. At least, not as much."
*"A smart choice, Miss."
    "An early investment for an eternal afterlife."
    ->CEThirdRound

*"I wouldn't say it's fortunate, but it reforms your afterlife down here."
    "You see, you have the quality that everyone else here have not. How precious, ha, how brilliant!
    ->CEThirdRound
*"You have the ability to forget! You are the rarest, the fairest of them all, Miss."
